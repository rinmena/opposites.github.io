    In my project, I drew two headshot drawings of a couple: both in different aesthetics in attire. The story is they’re a couple in love! I included some dreamy-like happy music to fit the mood. I chose this theme because it seemed like a common concept in couples that I’ve seen in media/Anime and I love drawing romance themed art. I was heavily inspired by my favorite anime, Nana. </p>
